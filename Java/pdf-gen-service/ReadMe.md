```

Or use Spring Boot directly:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Run the application locally using Docker
You can run the application locally using Docker once an environmental variables list 
has been added to a new .env file. 

- Copy the supplied .env.template file to a .env file. 

- Customize your environmental variables in the new .env file.  

- Launch the containerized application  

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
**Note: If RabbitMQ is also containerized, you may have to create a common network and attach otherwise each container
is isolated from the other.
