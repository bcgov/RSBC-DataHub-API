    <p>Dear <span th:text="${lawyerFirstName}"></span> <span th:text="${lawyerLastName}"></span>,</p>

    <p>Please find attached the completed PDF of your application for review of driving prohibition <span th:text="${noticeNumber}"></span>.</p>

    <p><strong>You must not drive while your licence is prohibited.</strong> Driving while prohibited is illegal. It carries a minimum fine of $500 for a first offence, a 12-month prohibition, and possible imprisonment. <strong>Imprisonment is mandatory for a second offence.</strong></p>

    <p>Thank you,<br>
    RoadSafetyBC</p>
