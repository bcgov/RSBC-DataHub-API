    You'll need to apply in-person for a review:

        <li>
            Visit
            <a href="{{ link_to_icbc }}">ICBC</a>,
            <a href="{{ link_to_service_bc }}">ServiceBC</a>
            or an appointed agent right away to meet the application deadline.
            Walk-in visits are limited so arrive early.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take your Notice of Prohibition with you.
        </li>
        <li>
            If your licence was not surrendered to police, bring it with you.
        </li>
        <li>
            Complete an Application for a Review of a Driving Prohibition.
