# Road Safety DataHub API

A series of Python components that process eTicketing and digital forms for RoadSafety BC.

At the present time, these components process the following types of events:

Electronic Tickets:
- the issuance of a ticket
- the payment of a ticket
- the dispute of a ticket
- the status of a dispute
- the finding of a disputed ticket
- the query of a ticket record
  
Driving Prohibition Reviews
- the application to review
- the payment for a review
- the scheduling of a review
- the release of police evidence 


The system to handle these events is made up of seven containers / pods:
- An ingestor that accepts events as either XML or JSON data
- A Message Broker (RabbitMQ) that stores the events while they're being processed.
- A validator that checks events to make sure required fields are included
- A geocoder that determines the geolocation of an address
- An API endpoint for PayBC to query for payable items
- A writer that inserts the data into the business intelligence database
- A form handler that processes digital form submissions
