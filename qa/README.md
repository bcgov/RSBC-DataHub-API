# Digital Forms quality assurance (testing)

This is a collection of projects for manual and automated testing in the Digital Forms project:

- **autofill**: Settings that can be imported into the [Autofill browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autofill/nlmmgnhgdeffjkdckmikfpnddkbbfkkk) to populate form fields and selections on a web page quickly.
- **jmeter**: [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) script. This was originally used for interactive and exploratory testing of the DFAPI. JMeter is no longer used,  before DFAPI and ORDS endpoints were restricted between the namespaces.
- **robot**: [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) test suites used for DF and DFAPI testing.
- **script**: helper scripts.
- **testcafe**: [TestCafe](https://testcafe.io/) automated test suites used for DFTTF (12/24) forms.
