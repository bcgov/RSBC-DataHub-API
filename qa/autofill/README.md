# Autofill browser extension

The Autofill extension works in Firefox and Chromium-based browsers, and auto-fills fields, radio buttons, and selections. Be sure to get the one made by [https://www.tohodo.com/](Tohodo).


## Invoking Autofill profiles

This configuration allows you to instantaneously fill all the fields on 12- and 24-hour prohibition forms. There's a profile for 12-hour forms, and another for 24-hour forms. You can trigger the form completion by pressing the following hotkeys:

- Alt + 2: fill out fields for the 12-hour form.
- Alt + 4: Fill out fields for the 24-hour form.

Once the form is filled out, you can make changes to the values, or print the forms. 


## How to import the configuration

After installing Autofill, go to the extension options page *Import/Export* tab. Copy the configuration from [file:///autofill.txt](autofill.txt) and paste it into the text area. Switch to the *Form Fields* tab, go to the bottom of the page, and select Save.


## Making changes to the values entered into the forms

Go to the Autofill extension options page. On the Form Fields tab, select either the 12- or 24-hour profile, and find the filed you want to change. After making the change to its value, or adding or removing fields, select the Save button at the bottom of the page. For details on how to configure fields, see the [documentation](https://www.tohodo.com/autofill/help.html).
